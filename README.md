I'm a fresh graduated student from the faculty of Computers and Artificial Intelligence, Helwan University.
I'm interested in the Data Analysis field and have taken many courses from Udacity, DataCamp and Microsoft platforms about data analysis using
Excel, Python and Power BI tools and did projects on them.
